# Next Work

Last Updated: 2026-08-23

Use this file as the starting point when resuming work or asking "what's next?". It is a pointer to the authoritative plan, not a duplicate progress tracker.

## Current Priority

**Task:** `S1-05` - Add typed frontend `ApiProblem` parsing and classification for JSON, text, and Blob responses.

**Authoritative plan:** [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

**Current stage:** Stage 1 - Error Contract and Immediate Defects

**Required outcome:**

- Define typed frontend models for the agreed ProblemDetails shape and optional field errors.
- Parse normal JSON problem bodies, plain-text bodies, and Blob responses from download/export requests.
- Classify by stable `code` first and HTTP status second.
- Always return safe string messages and preserve correlation IDs when available.
- Distinguish validation, conflict, authentication, authorization, timeout, and server failures.

**Immediate validation:** Add focused frontend utility tests for JSON, text, malformed, and Blob responses, then run `npm run test:ci`. `S1-06` follows by replacing duplicated component extraction with the shared utility.

## Work Order

1. Continue the first incomplete task in [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. Do not begin a dependent stage until the current stage gate passes.
3. Treat [TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md](TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md) as the high-level product roadmap only.
4. Treat files under [todo](todo/) as intentionally deferred; do not select them unless explicitly requested.
5. Treat files under [archive](archive/) as historical records, not active work queues.

## Update Rules

At the end of each work session:

1. Update task checkboxes, dashboard totals, `Current Stage`, `Next Task`, `Last Updated`, and validation log in the authoritative plan.
2. Update this file only when the current priority, authoritative plan, or deferral decision changes.
3. Keep implementation details and validation evidence in the appropriate plan rather than copying them here.
4. When a plan is complete, ensure durable usage or maintenance information is in the README, then archive the plan.

## Deferred Work

- [Azure deployment](todo/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md)
- [JSON import/export follow-up](todo/JSON_IMPORT_EXPORT_PLAN.md)

## Completed Records

Completed implementation plans are stored under [archive](archive/). Ongoing launcher usage and maintenance instructions live in the root [README](../README.md).
