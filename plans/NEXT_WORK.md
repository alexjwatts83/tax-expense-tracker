# Next Work

Last Updated: 2026-08-23

Use this file as the starting point when resuming work or asking "what's next?". It is a pointer to the authoritative plan, not a duplicate progress tracker.

## Current Priority

**Task:** Begin Stage 7 with `S7-01`: avoid reference-data queries for unrelated per-entity exports.

**Authoritative plan:** [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

**Current stage:** Stage 7 - DataTransfer Hardening

**Required outcome:**

- Route per-entity exports to repositories for only the requested entity type.
- Avoid loading all trackers, tags, banks, and public holidays for unrelated exports.
- Preserve the existing streamed JSON response contracts and soft-delete behavior.
- Add query-count or repository-call tests before advancing to import atomicity work.

**Immediate validation:** Add focused service/controller tests proving each per-entity export touches only its owning repository.

**Done in this session:** Stage 6 is complete. A real SQLite upgrade test verifies reference audit backfills; streamed API exports expose camel-case audit fields; 198 backend tests and 67 frontend tests pass; the production build passes with the two existing budget warnings.

**Stage 2 note:** S2-09/S2-10 remain blocked on Azure/Entra provisioning.

## Work Order

1. Continue the first incomplete task in [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. Do not begin a dependent stage until the current stage gate passes.
3. Treat [TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md](TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md) as the high-level product roadmap only.
4. Treat files under [todo](todo/) as intentionally deferred; do not select them unless explicitly requested.
5. Treat files under [archive](archive/) as historical records, not active work queues.

## Update Rules

At the end of each work session:

1. Update task checkboxes, dashboard totals, `Current Stage`, `Next Task`, `Last Updated`, and validation log in the authoritative plan.
2. Update this file only when the current priority, authoritative plan, or deferral decision changes.
3. Keep implementation details and validation evidence in the appropriate plan rather than copying them here.
4. When a plan is complete, ensure durable usage or maintenance information is in the README, then archive the plan.

## Deferred Work

- Stage 2 `S2-09`/`S2-10`: Azure/Entra provisioning and the deployed anonymous/non-owner/owner matrix. Blocked until the target tenant and registration values are available. Keep `Authentication:UseDevelopmentTestScheme` disabled in Azure and Production.
- [Azure deployment](todo/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md)
- [JSON import/export follow-up](todo/JSON_IMPORT_EXPORT_PLAN.md)

## Completed Records

Completed implementation plans are stored under [archive](archive/). Ongoing launcher usage and maintenance instructions live in the root [README](../README.md).
