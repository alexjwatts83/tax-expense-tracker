# Next Work

Last Updated: 2026-08-23

Use this file as the starting point when resuming work or asking "what's next?". It is a pointer to the authoritative plan, not a duplicate progress tracker.

## Current Priority

**Task:** Complete the externally blocked Azure portion of Stage 8 task `S8-07` and Stage 2 tasks `S2-09`/`S2-10`.

**Authoritative plan:** [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

**Current stage:** Stage 8 - Quality Gates and Operational Readiness

**Required outcome:**

- Run the deployed anonymous/non-owner/owner Azure matrix when tenant resources exist.
- Validate deployed health, migrations, correlation logs, frontend workflows, and DataTransfer authorization.
- Mark S8-07 and the overall hardening plan complete only after those deployed checks pass.

**Immediate validation:** Run `az login`, replace required live-stack placeholders, provision/configure the Azure dev environment and Entra registrations, then execute the deployed role matrix.

**Done in this session:** All local Stage 8 work is complete. The final gate passed 219/219 .NET tests, 75/75 frontend tests, migration generation, production build, and live Production API health/data/error-contract smoke. Azure sign-off is explicitly blocked: Azure CLI is unauthenticated, no stack is applied, and live inputs still contain placeholders.

**Stage 2 note:** S2-09/S2-10 remain blocked on Azure/Entra provisioning.

## Work Order

1. Continue the first incomplete task in [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. Do not begin a dependent stage until the current stage gate passes.
3. Treat [TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md](TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md) as the high-level product roadmap only.
4. Treat files under [todo](todo/) as intentionally deferred; do not select them unless explicitly requested.
5. Treat files under [archive](archive/) as historical records, not active work queues.

## Update Rules

At the end of each work session:

1. Update task checkboxes, dashboard totals, `Current Stage`, `Next Task`, `Last Updated`, and validation log in the authoritative plan.
2. Update this file only when the current priority, authoritative plan, or deferral decision changes.
3. Keep implementation details and validation evidence in the appropriate plan rather than copying them here.
4. When a plan is complete, ensure durable usage or maintenance information is in the README, then archive the plan.

## Deferred Work

- Stage 2 `S2-09`/`S2-10`: Azure/Entra provisioning and the deployed anonymous/non-owner/owner matrix. Blocked until the target tenant and registration values are available. Keep `Authentication:UseDevelopmentTestScheme` disabled in Azure and Production.
- [Azure deployment](todo/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md)
- [JSON import/export follow-up](todo/JSON_IMPORT_EXPORT_PLAN.md)

## Completed Records

Completed implementation plans are stored under [archive](archive/). Ongoing launcher usage and maintenance instructions live in the root [README](../README.md).
