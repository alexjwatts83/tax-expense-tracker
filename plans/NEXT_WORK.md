# Next Work

Last Updated: 2026-08-23

Use this file as the starting point when resuming work or asking "what's next?". It is a pointer to the authoritative plan, not a duplicate progress tracker.

## Current Priority

**Task:** Complete Stage 8 Slice A (`S8-01` + `S8-02` + `S8-03`): coverage and CI enforcement.

**Authoritative plan:** [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

**Current stage:** Stage 8 - Quality Gates and Operational Readiness

**Required outcome:**

- Complete backend architecture, API route, repository, query-filter, FK, and uniqueness coverage.
- Complete frontend service, critical component, guard, accessibility, and error-state coverage.
- Add CI checks for backend build/tests, plain SQLite migration-script generation, frontend tests, and the production build.

**Immediate validation:** Inventory the existing focused coverage and CI workflows, close only demonstrated gaps, then run the exact CI commands locally.

**Done in this session:** Stage 7 is complete. Near-ceiling parsing measured 7.35 ms median / 8.29 ms p95, so no worker was added. Active exports/imports have real unsubscribe-based cancellation and truthful stages; malformed and dry-run HTTP behavior is covered. The gate passed with 210/210 .NET tests, 72/72 frontend tests, and a successful production build.

**Stage 2 note:** S2-09/S2-10 remain blocked on Azure/Entra provisioning.

## Work Order

1. Continue the first incomplete task in [FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](FULL_STACK_HARDENING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
2. Do not begin a dependent stage until the current stage gate passes.
3. Treat [TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md](TAX_EXPENSE_TRACKER_PLAN.md) as the high-level product roadmap only.
4. Treat files under [todo](todo/) as intentionally deferred; do not select them unless explicitly requested.
5. Treat files under [archive](archive/) as historical records, not active work queues.

## Update Rules

At the end of each work session:

1. Update task checkboxes, dashboard totals, `Current Stage`, `Next Task`, `Last Updated`, and validation log in the authoritative plan.
2. Update this file only when the current priority, authoritative plan, or deferral decision changes.
3. Keep implementation details and validation evidence in the appropriate plan rather than copying them here.
4. When a plan is complete, ensure durable usage or maintenance information is in the README, then archive the plan.

## Deferred Work

- Stage 2 `S2-09`/`S2-10`: Azure/Entra provisioning and the deployed anonymous/non-owner/owner matrix. Blocked until the target tenant and registration values are available. Keep `Authentication:UseDevelopmentTestScheme` disabled in Azure and Production.
- [Azure deployment](todo/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TRACKER.md)
- [JSON import/export follow-up](todo/JSON_IMPORT_EXPORT_PLAN.md)

## Completed Records

Completed implementation plans are stored under [archive](archive/). Ongoing launcher usage and maintenance instructions live in the root [README](../README.md).
